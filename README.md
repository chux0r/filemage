Filemage is a utility package written in Go that helps validate files. 
1) No-choke limit! Samples 1st 100 bytes of file only. 
2) Uses file magic signatures to attempt identification  
3) Scans for UTF-8 to determine text or binary
    
## FileMagicEval
Tickles an input file header's file magic to determine what the filetype _really_ is, regardless of context or extension.   
   
## IsThisUtf8 
Input a byte slice and get back the answer, the byte length of the utf-8 encoded stuff, and any utf-8 text as a string (binary stripped)   
   
## HttpFileHeadMagicCheck
Input a URL and get back the filetype, if it can be determined ("" returned if it cannot.)
*NOTE: File read limits to 1st 100 bytes*
