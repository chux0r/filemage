# filemage

Filemage is a utility package that helps validate files. 
1) No-choke limit! Samples 1st 100 bytes of file only. 
2) Uses file magic signatures to attempt identification  
3) Scans for UTF-8 chracters to determine text or binary

Written for use with QR Sentry security steps and file validation, but probably plenty useful for other stuff.
